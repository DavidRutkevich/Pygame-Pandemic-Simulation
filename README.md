**Some Variable and function names are in german**




A Human is represented by a circle, the state of each Human at an given time is represented by its color. 
* **Red** = Infected 
* **Blue** = Not infected
* **Green** = Recovered

The Graph shows the amount of humans in a specific state at a given time.
* **Red** = Infected 
* **Purple** = Dead
* **Green** = Recovered

You can customize the time and speed by changing the values of the T or the velocity attribute of the Persons class.

**Note that changing T(time) will impact the generation of the graph**
